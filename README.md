## Fun Fact ⚡

**JavaScript Myth-Busting:**  
JavaScript can't install viruses, but it can download files. Its true danger lies in social engineering. Always stay vigilant—if a website seems suspicious, prepend `view-source:` to the URL to inspect the code. Be wary of script tags linking to dubious, scrambled URLs.


## Projects & Highlights ✨

- **[Portfolio Website](https://crazystuffofficial.github.io/youareanidiot.org):** A main page I made a long time ago with a lot of games free to play.
- **[PHP Spy](https://github.com/crazystuffofficial/PHPSpy):** A PHP website that can be used to gather information on people. It also helps users understand that websites can trick them, and to stay cautious.
- **[Static browser](https://github.com/crazystuffofficial/browser-static):** A completely static and private browser that has a built in proxy that uses a node.js bare server to use it's own DNS as its IP adress.
